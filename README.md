description: Verify Authorship of Webpages

# WebVerify

The World Wide Web is driven by hyperlinks. Yet, a lot of the time we'll follow a link and end up on a completely different page to what we'd expect. Throughout a link's life, its domain will change owners, its servers will change owners, its content will be modified by other authors. Nothing is permanent.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could link to a page and ensure it remains under the same author? And if authors didn't have to worry about paying for a domain to stop all those links going to fishy websites?

WebVerify provides a proof-of-concept solution to exactly this problem. To summarise:

* Authors sign web pages.
* Links enforce authorship.
* Readers verify authors.
