# Installation

The Web Extension is currently in development and only works on Firefox.

{% hint style="warning" %}
WebVerify is currently an experimental proof-of-concept. Try it out at your own risk, but don't leave it installed during regular web browsing.
{% endhint %}

1. Download XPI file from [the latest release](https://github.com/jahed/webverify/releases/latest) of the Web Extension.
2. If you're using Firefox, a pop-up will appear to install it.

### Manually Installing the XPI

If you choose not to install the XPI from the download prompt, you can install it manually.

1. In Firefox, go to the Add-Ons Manager \(about:addons\)
2. Choose "Extensions" on the left menu
3. Click the Cog icon
4. Choose "Install Add-on From File..."
5. Choose the XPI you just downloaded.
6. You're done!
